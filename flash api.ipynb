the SUMO squat is to adopt a broader position than the traditional squat.The position of the sumo is a wide position.However, an extremely wide position with an exaggerated position of the feet outwards can reduce the ability to lift loads by putting you in an unfavorable position.So try to find the position that allows you to lift the most loads while being comfortable.\",\"Although you can try different foot widths (this is another way to vary this exercise), you should always adopt a position that seems comfortable to you depending on your flexibility and the amplitude of your movements.Do not adopt a too wide position if you don't feel comfortable.A very wide position is not necessarily better and can even increase the risk of clashing.\",\"It is normal and correct that your chest is slightly leaning forward.However, if you want to do a job more focused on the quadriceps, adjust the position of your feet and your handling of the dumbbell to keep a torso straight (vertical).\",\"It can be slightly embarrassing to hold the dumbbell with one hand over the other, but there is an alternative.One of the variants is to hold the dumbbell vertically at the upper discs.\",\"Some people do not have the flexibility necessary to do this exercise in depth and in width, but it is not a major drawback either, because each individual can start using the amplitude of movement in which he iseasy.\",\"If you perform the sumo squat from a raised position to obtain a greater amplitude of motion, be sure to be completely warm, increase the depth of your squat gradually from one training session to another andDo not go lower than your amplitude of motion allows it.I have seen many people tear their thigh muscles trying to squat more deeply than what their natural flexibility allowed them or trying to work too heavy too early.\",\"Beginners can start this exercise in body weight.\",\"The increase in the amplitude of movement by going lower, in particular by performing the raised sumo squat, is also a form of progression.However, make very deep or very wide sumo squats with care, as mentioned above.\",\"If you want to make the exercise much more difficult, even using lighter loads, you can slow down eccentric movements and mark breaks in the low position.For example, you can go down in a squat position while counting up to 4, then stay in the

English Walking Lungs) are one of the most popular variants.Instead of taking a step forward and then returning to the same starting position, the market slots correspond exactly to what their name describes: you walk in the room.This requires a large space and is therefore not necessarily practical in small sports rooms or at home (if time allows, the market slots can be practiced outside).The inverted slot is another very popular variant where you take a step back instead of a step forward.Diagonal slots and side slots involve other leg muscles in movement.\",\"Slirts can also be carried out with any other bodybuilding equipment, such as dumbbells, kettlebells, a weighted vest, etc.\",\"The split squat can be considered as a variant of the slit, with the difference that there is no step, or moving forward or backwards.The split squat is a movement from top to bottom only.Although some people use the terms \\u201cslit\\u201d and \\u201csplit squat\\u201d indifferently, these are different exercises not to be confused.The slit is an exercise with a movement of steps.The split squat is a stationary exercise (on site).\",\"One of the main errors with the slits is not to go far enough.Your goal is to reach an angle of 90 degrees in the two knees.You do not have to touch the ground with your rear knee, but to obtain a complete amplitude of motion, you must approach

forward.You should keep the chest right during this exercise, as it reduces the fatigue from the lower back and to solicit the quadriceps.If you look forward, you will notice that the exercise is easier and that is why many people do it, especially when they are tired.It's easier because your lower back and hips take over on your thighs.Although it is natural to lean a little forward, it is important to remain more or less straight and not to round your back.The good benchmarks to remember are: standing straight, your head high, the high chest.\",\"Another error is to take too short steps forward.Short steps can put more pressure on quadriceps, but they also increase knee fatigue.Taking a large enough step forward makes it possible to fully activate the glutes.\",\"If your
