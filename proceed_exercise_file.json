main advice to remember when you make shoulder rise is to imagine that you want to touch your ears with your shoulders.Of course, you can't really do it, and the amplitude of movement during an uprust is very low, but if you are mentally focused on this instruction, you will manage to perform the complete movement.","Remember not to use your arms when you raise your shoulders.You can keep your elbows slightly unlocked, but do not fold them (flexion) during movement, as it would amount to using the biceps to lift the load.This is not an exercise for the arms.","The dumbbells allow you to vary the exercise of the shoulder to change the position of your hands and arms compared to your body.One of the most popular variants is to hold the dumbbells in front of the body rather than on the sides.Some people find that they may lift more charges this way.","Another variant, less known, but just as excellent, is to hold the dumbbells behind the back (palms turned back).","Shrugs with dumbbells are generally standing, but an excellent variant that few people know is the seated shrug.The advantage is that the sitting version cannot be cheated, as the legs cannot be used to lift the dumbbells.","Another variant is the rise of dumbbells in the inclined position.It is carried out with the chest and belly leaning on a very inclined bench.With this inclination, you can do a \u201csecret\u201d exercise used by many bodybuilders and fitness athletes to develop both the upper trapeze and the average trapeze (between the shoulder blades).","The biggest error about shrug with dumbbells is to believe that it is better to roll your shoulders back and forth when you make the movement.This advice has been circulating in the bodybuilding rooms for decades, but it is enough to think about the orientation of the force of gravity to realize that the movement of shift in this way does not allow the different parts to workTrapezius, including the upper and medium trapezius, as we imagine.","The grip force is often a limiting factor during a series of shrugs, which is why many practitioners use lifting straps.Unless you intentionally want to train to strengthen your grip, there is no shame in using bodybuilding straps.","Heavy shrugs may have a slight risk of tension in the lower back.People with history of low backgrounds and those who wish to make shifts as heavy as possible must take this into account.The variant where the dumbbells are held in front of the thighs represents the most risky posture, because the body is slightly deported forward.This is why the version in neutral intake is generally recommended in general (this is undoubtedly the safest version).","A great way to guarantee good technique and make the exercise more difficult is to do maximum contraction for at least two seconds, or even three seconds to obtain a really vigorous maximum contraction.If you can't hold at all at all, this is a sign that you may be using too much

you have made the number of repetitions planned."]},"Tips ":{"Training advice":["The principle of the SUMO squat is to adopt a broader position than the traditional squat.The position of the sumo is a wide position.However, an extremely wide position with an exaggerated position of the feet outwards can reduce the ability to lift loads by putting you in an unfavorable position.So try to find the position that allows you to lift the most loads while being comfortable.","Although you can try different foot widths (this is another way to vary this exercise), you should always adopt a position that seems comfortable to you depending on your flexibility and the amplitude of your movements.Do not adopt a too wide position if you don't feel comfortable.A very wide position is not necessarily better and can even increase the risk of clashing.","It is normal and correct that your chest is slightly leaning forward.However, if you want to do a job more focused on the quadriceps, adjust the position of your feet and your handling of the dumbbell to keep a torso straight (vertical).","It can be slightly embarrassing to hold the dumbbell with one hand over the other, but there is an alternative.One of the variants is to hold the dumbbell vertically at the upper discs.","Some people do not have the flexibility necessary to do this exercise in depth and in width, but it is not a major drawback either, because each individual can start using the amplitude of movement in which he iseasy.","If you perform the sumo squat from a raised position to obtain a greater amplitude of motion, be sure to be completely warm, increase the depth of your squat gradually from one training session to another andDo not go lower than your amplitude of motion allows it.I have seen many people tear their thigh muscles trying to squat more deeply than what their natural flexibility allowed them or trying to work too heavy too early.","Beginners can start this exercise in body weight.","The increase in the amplitude of movement by going lower, in particular by performing the raised sumo squat, is also a form of progression.However, make very deep or very wide sumo squats with care, as mentioned above.","If you want to make the exercise much more difficult, even using lighter loads, you can slow down eccentric movements and mark breaks in the low position.For example, you can go down in a squat position while counting up to 4, then stay in the low position while counting up to 2 or 3 before getting up in 1 second.","Finally, if you really want to sculpt your

can start with a vacuum bar or even with body weight.Olympic weightlifting and crossfit followers often perform this exercise by placing the bar on the front of the shoulders.These athletes also often make slots while holding the bar above their heads (overhead).","The slots (in English Walking Lungs) are one of the most popular variants.Instead of taking a step forward and then returning to the same starting position, the market slots correspond exactly to what their name describes: you walk in the room.This requires a large space and is therefore not necessarily practical in small sports rooms or at home (if time allows, the market slots can be practiced outside).The inverted slot is another very popular variant where you take a step back instead of a step forward.Diagonal slots and side slots involve other leg muscles in movement.","Slirts can also be carried out with any other bodybuilding equipment, such as dumbbells, kettlebells, a weighted vest, etc.","The split squat can be considered as a variant of the slit, with the difference that there is no step, or moving forward or backwards.The split squat is a movement from top to bottom only.Although some people use the terms \u201cslit\u201d and \u201csplit squat\u201d indifferently, these are different exercises not to be confused.The slit is an exercise with a movement of steps.The split squat is a stationary exercise (on site).","One of the main errors with the slits is not to go far enough.Your goal is to reach an angle of 90 degrees in the two knees.You do not have to touch the ground with your rear knee, but to obtain a complete amplitude of motion, you must approach it.",{"src":"https:\/\/www.docteur-fitness.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/fente-avant-barre-vue-profil-homme.gif","caption":"The front

look forward, you will notice that the exercise is easier and that is why many people do it, especially when they are tired.It's easier because your lower back and hips take over on your thighs.Although it is natural to lean a little forward, it is important to remain more or less straight and not to round your back.The good benchmarks to remember are: standing straight, your head high, the high chest.","Another error is to take too short steps forward.Short steps can put more pressure on quadriceps, but they also increase knee fatigue.Taking a large enough step forward makes it possible to fully activate the glutes.","If your program provides 8 to 12 repetitions, you must make 8 to 12 repetitions for each leg, and not 8 to 12 repetitions in total!This is also one of the

the reason why many people prefer to use the declined version.","This movement can also be carried out on an inclined bench to benefit from another working angle.To maintain the tension, this variation is generally done with the arms slightly behind the head.For people who train at home without a bench, you can do this exercise on the ground.","The biggest error that most people do on this exercise is to use the shoulders to raise the dumbbells, transforming the exercise into apull-over.","The second major error is to let the elbows move away, which can reduce tension on the triceps.It is therefore a common way to cheat with this exercise when it starts to become difficult.So keep your elbows in the same position for the duration of the exercise.","If you do not train in a crowded room and have a dumbbell rack at your disposal, try to make a drop set on your last series of extensions: it's a great way to finish and get congestionmuscles.","The emphasis on the eccentric can make these exercises much more interesting, so try to slow down the rhythm, especially in the descent phase of the movement, and see what it gives.","Last point, but not the least, extensions with lying dumbbells are an ideal exercise to associate with the curl seated with two dumbbells (for biceps) to make Unsuperset.Just make a series of extensions with lying dumbbells, then sit at the end of the

ultra fast training, but complete from the upper body to the house without using free loads, you cannot do better than combine Despompes (horizontal thrusts) and inverted rowing (drawhorizontal).If you simply make 3 series of each exercise, without rest (and a short rest between Lessupersets), you will work all the muscles of the upper body: pectoral, back, shoulders, biceps, tricet, in addition, you will activate the abdominal muscles.Advanced practitioners will be able to increase this number of series to 4 or 5 per exercise.You will still have finished in a few minutes.","For the version with table, make sure that the table is in place on the ground and that it is not likely to slip when you exercise.It goes without saying that you must also make sure that the table is solid (I decline any responsibility in the event of breakage of the table, you are warned).","For the chair version, make sure that the broom handle or the bar are also stable and solid enough to support your weight.If necessary, you can fold a towel on each chair to prevent the broom handle from running on top of the chairs.","You can modify the width of your socket, by choosing a position of the hands that is more comfortable to you, where you feel the most stimulation in the back muscles, or you can change the plug just to vary.The medium and close sockets will tend to make the flexors of the arm work more.If you use a narrow table, you can also sometimes adopt a neutral socket.","If you do the reverse rowing between chairs using a broom handle, you also have the possibility of adopting a pronation or supination.The supination will make your biceps work much more intensely.","Remember that the smaller the angle of your body, the more difficult the exercise will be, because the more horizontal your body, the less your weight rests on your feet and the more you have to lift the weight of your body.This means that if you want to make the exercise more difficult, just put your feet on a chair, a stool, a bench, a box or a balloon (to add a balance of balance).","When you reach the stage where you can make a large number of rehearsals with the tense legs, and if that seems too easy, you can start adding weight.The ideal is to use a weighted.If you don't have one and you don't want to invest in a vest, you can load a backpack and put it on you.","The most difficult technique to practice (only for experienced practitioners) is that which consists in using only one arm at a time.Even the best athletes can have difficulties with this advanced variant, especially with the tense legs (you can do it with the bent knees, the feet on the ground or the tense legs).","If you have access to a bodybuilding room equipped with dumbbells, most people will prefer to make Durowing with dumbbells that it is inverted to an arm, at least if the main objective is to develop muscle mass and strength.But if you don't have dumbbells, you now know how to build your back.","Remember that increasing the number of repetitions is another form of progression, particularly useful for body weight exercises.If you normally make series from 8 to 12 and 12 repetitions are starting to become easy, do not hesitate to increase the number of repetitions of this exercise to 15, 20 or even more, if you can do the same.This is a possibility, rather than going to a more difficult variant or adding load.","Increasing the number of series is also a way of progressing, so if you are used to doing 3 series and you cannot or do not want to make a different variant or add weight, you can simply add a series.You cannot add series eternally, and more series and rehearsals are not always better, but it is still a way of reaching a progressive

natural position (do not round it).","When you do the rowing at the helm, one of the main questions that arise is how far you should look.There are many variants of the leaning position, the hanging position completely leaning at almost 90 degrees, including the Yates 45 degree position where the torso is more vertical.","An error to avoid is to stand too straight.When your upper body is tilted forward at 45 degrees, it remains a movement of Rowing, but it is not an uptop or a vertical movement.Nevertheless, many people do this exercise by standing almost entirely standing.This is a technical error, because it reduces the amplitude of movement for an exercise that already does not have much.","With the inverted socket (in supination), the bicepssont placed in a favorable position and also contribute to the movement.Your elbows will naturally be directed backwards (the elbows will not evade on the sides as is the case during a rowing with a pronation).","In addition to the position of the hands (in pronation or in supination), the width of the socket represents additional variants.However, this exercise is preferably done with the grip of the shoulders or slightly wider.If your socket is too narrow, you may feel greater tension in the wrists.A too narrow socket also requests biceps too much and reduces the amount of weight that you can lift with the back muscles.If you enter the bar with an overly wide socket, you will simply further reduce the amplitude of movement.Just as you can do with hand positions in pronation or supination, if you experience different socket widths, you may find the most comfortable, which reduces tension on the joints or that allows youto obtain the highest contraction of the upper back muscles.","Whatever variant you use, it is better to do this exercise while respecting a very strict technique and leaving aside your ego.Although rowing is considered to be a compound \u201cheavy\u201d composed, it is preferable to

bottom of the movement.At the top of the movement, you should feel a strong contraction in the glutes.","Many bodybuilding rooms do not have a GHD, but most of them have a 45 -degree bench.Doing this exercise at an angle of 45 degrees is a little easier, but remains an interesting version, so if you do not have a horizontal bench, go to the 45 degree version.Note that if you started on the lumbar extension bench at 45 degrees, the transition to the horizontal bench is a real progression: it is more difficult due to the effect of gravity.","The body weight is sufficient for most beginners, but confirmed athletes and practitioners generally add weight as the force increases, rather than making a greater number of repetitions.","Hip extensions to GHD can be carried out with a single leg at a time (unilaterally).This variant is extremely demanding, which is why most people start by making this movement with two feet fixed under the cushion, and go to the version to one leg that after having obtained a sufficient level of force.For the unilateral version, you will have to anchor a single leg under the cushion and let the other leg (foot) rest slightly on the top of the cushion, which obliges the fixed leg to do all the work.","If you want to use advanced techniques, repetitions with maximum contraction are very interesting.Just keep the position high and contract your glutes, at least for a second, but you can maintain the high position for 1 to 3 seconds.This makes the exercise much more difficult (and therefore also limits the weight you can use).","If you deliberately want to involve the lower back more, you can go back on the cushion so that the bottom of your size is sustained, then you can use a spine extension movement rather than a movement

to avoid these errors by controlling the load at every moment.","This exercise is not very dangerous and is not associated with risks of injury.In the illustration of side elevations to an arm above, the arm was lifted slightly above the parallel on the ground.This must be considered a complete amplitude of motion.In fact, as long as you raise your arm parallel to the ground, your deltoids will be fully contracted.There are few advantages to go much higher, because the tension decreases as you exceed the parallel, and there is a slight risk of conflict at the shoulder if you go too high or ifYou try to lift the handle over your head.","As with many pulley exercises, the Drop Set technique is particularly effective in intensifying your training.Just remove the pin from the weight battery

Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.","3: Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.","4: As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out.

Continue until you have risen to a standing position.","6: The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward.

To begin, first set a flat bench behind you and set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.","2: Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.","3: Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note:For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).","4: Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.Tip:If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.","5: Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.","6: Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."]},"Tips ":null,"Level":"beginner","Type de Exercice":["strength"],"Mistake to Avoid ":null,"Video":null,"Variants":null,"Benefits":null},{"_id":1170,"name":"Anterior Tibialis-SMR","Equipement":["other"],"muscles_involved":["calves"],"image_src_note":{"title":"Anterior Tibialis-SMR Images","src":["https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/exercises\/exerciseImages\/sequences\/623\/Male\/l\/623_1.jpg","https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/exercises\/exerciseImages\/sequences\/623\/Male\/l\/623_2.jpg"]},"Category":null,"Steps":{"Images":"https:\/\/artifacts.bbcomcdn.com\/@bbcom\/exercises-app\/2.1.2\/img\/guide-9.gif","Anterior Tibialis-SMR Instructions":["1: Begin seated on the ground with your legs bent and your feet on the floor.","2: Using a Muscle Roller or a rolling pin, apply pressure to the muscles on the outside of your shins.
